If you were typing along you should have noticed that VSCode shows you autocompletion results for available properties and methods on classes and instances (e.g. `new Dash.Client()`, `client.getWalletAccount()`, etc). With that you can play around with what the SDK has to offer.

The full DashJS documentation can be found under [https://dashevo.github.io/DashJS/#/](https://dashevo.github.io/DashJS/#/).
For more code examples on e.g. Identities, Usernames, Datacontracts, etc. please visit [https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs/tutorial-register-an-identity](https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs/tutorial-register-an-identity).
