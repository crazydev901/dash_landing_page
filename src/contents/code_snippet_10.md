Again, comment out the last line from the previous step // checkAccountBalance();
and run with npm start.

The output should be similar to:
```
> dashjs_example@1.0.0 start ~/dashJS_example
> node src/index.js

Transaction broadcast!

```
You can now check the account balance again like in the previous step, to confirm that â€˜however many Dash you had' have been sent.
