Hint: To auto format your JS code you can use one of the following shortcuts:

Windows: `Shift` + `Alt` + `F`
Mac: `Shift` + `Option` + `F`
Linux: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` or `Shift` + `Alt` + `I`
If none of the above work, you can also try:
`Ctrl` + `K` and then `Ctrl` + `F`

When you do this the first time you might have to choose a code formatter. Just click on configure on the popup window and choose one of the codeformatters.
